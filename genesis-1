          	WELCOME TO light ' HolyCode 

HolyCode is better, faster and much faster than Neovim/Vim
I took, everything i liked out of Vim, and added it to 
light.

HolyCode(or, light) is infinitely configurable, in
two major ways -> 
	. shortcuts
	. plugins

Look at the code, to get a feel of it(./light/holy-C.c)
You can: 
|	|-> jump to the first/ last line
|	|-> jump to beginning/ending of the same line
|	|-> delete current line
|	|-> clear current line
|	|-> skip to some line
|	|-> and more
|
|__ all this happens through normal plugins
		and shortcut functions, there is
			no magic, except God's magic

There is no overhead at runtime for any of this,
I display a DISPLAY_BUFFER[][] and make it so that
at different stages you can either add plugins
(note: plugins are called everytime user input is
received) or shortcuts(note: shortcuts are only 
called with certain character combinations 
beginning with Ctrl-character) to affect the way the
buffer is displayed.

Everything besides the DISPLAY_BUFFER that you interact with
is essentially a plugin, even line numbers are shown using a 
plugin, called something like:

	plugin_line_no(..);

Hence, light is extensible
But has hard boundaries, making things I deem not worthwhile
very hard to do- so is the nature of GOD, 
Hence, 
Walk with God, stride not against him!
